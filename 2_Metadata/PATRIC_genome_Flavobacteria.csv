Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","collected_by:University of Louisville",97.6,96.5,,,,"Good","2020-04-26T14:37:36.443Z","2020-04-26T14:37:36.443Z"

Here we report on the generation and analysis of the genome of the Formosa agariphila type strain KMM 3901T – an isolate from the green algae Acrosiphonia sonderi. F. agariphila is a facultative anaerobe with the capacity for mixed acid fermentation and denitrification. Its genome harbors 129 proteases and 88 glycoside hydrolases, indicating a pronounced specialization on the degradation of proteins, polysaccharides and glycoproteins. 65 of the glycoside hydrolases are organized in at least 13 distinct polysaccharide utilization loci, where they are clustered with TonB-dependent receptors, SusD-like proteins, sensors/transcription factors, transporters and oftentimes sulfatases. These loci play a pivotal role in bacteroidetal polysaccharide biodegradation, and in the case of F. agariphila revealed the capacity to degrade a wide range of algal polysaccharide from green, red and brown algae and thus a strong adaption towards an algae-associated lifestyle.",,98.2,97,100,,,"Good","2014-12-08T22:39:44.623Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

Novel secondary metabolites from as-yet-unknown or atypical microorganisms from both temperate and extreme environments have realistic potential to lead to new drugs with tremendous benefit for human health. In this work, we used a novel approach that mimics the natural environment by using a Miniaturized Culture Chip (MCC) allowing the isolation of several bacterial strains from Antarctic shallow water sediments under near natural conditions.

These uncultured genomes substantially expand the known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota, with a 281% increase in phylogenetic diversity. Although the newly identified species are less prevalent in well-studied populations compared to reference isolate genomes, they improve classification of understudied African and South American samples by more than 200%. These candidate species encode hundreds of newly identified biosynthetic gene clusters and possess a distinctive functional capacity that might explain their elusive nature.

Chitinase and NRPS genes were expressed in these endophytic bacterial families primarily upon pathogen challenge of the roots. Following de novo genome assembly, a consortium of endophytic Chitinophaga and Flavobacterium was reconstructed that suppressed root disease more consistently than individual members. CRISPR-Cas-based mutagenesis further revealed that a novel NRPS-PKS hybrid gene cluster from Flavobacterium was key to the disease-suppressive activity of the endophytic consortium.

Furthermore, contaminated wastewater stored in tailings dams may pose an environmental threat through the potential for leakage into local groundwater. Microbial communities are often used for biodegradation and environmental remediation, however, little is known about the membership and metabolic potential of SCN-degrading consortia. Application and improvement of the remediation strategy will benefit from an understanding of organisms that can contribute to the breakdown of SCN- into sulfur, carbon and nitrogen compounds. To this end, we performed metagenomic analysis of samples from two laboratory-scale bioreactors used to study SCN- and CN- degradation by established microbial consortia. Community analysis revealed the dominance of Thiobacillus spp. whose genomes harbor a previously unreported operon for SCN- degradation. Metabolic predictions suggest that a large portion of each bioreactor community is autotrophic, relying not on molasses in reactor feed, but using energy gained from oxidation of the sulfur compounds produced during SCN- degradation. Heterotrophs compose a smaller portion of the reactor bacterial community, and predation by phage and eukaryotes is predicted to affect community dynamics. Furthermore, genes for ammonium oxidation and denitrification were detected, possibly allowing removal of nitrogen as required for complete remediation of wastewater. These findings suggest possible optimization strategies for reactor design such as improved aerobic/anaerobic partitioning and elimination of organic carbon from reactor feed.;derived from metagenome",,97.9,79.7,96.8,35.6,,"Good","2016-11-16T05:42:23.353Z","2016-11-16T05:42:23.353Z"

Currently, little is known about the capacity of organisms resident in such environments to fix CO2. Here we investigated the CO2 fixation capacity of microorganisms in groundwater from the CO2–driven Crystal Geyser, located near Green River, Utah (USA). We reconstructed and analyzed 227 near-complete microbial genomes, representing 150 distinct species. At least 25% of the studied organisms are predicted to be autotrophs, and these represent a substantial portion the community. The most common carbon fixation pathways were the Calvin Benson Basham Cycle and Wood-Ljungdhal pathway, which incorporate readily available CO2 rather than bicarbonate. Unexpectedly, one organism from a novel phylum sibling to the candidate phyla radiation has genes of the reverse TCA cycle, which it may use to fix CO2. Autotrophic metabolism is likely supported by iron and sulfur cycling and by H2 produced by fermentation. These resources may be provided as trace components in the CO2 stream or could be liberated from minerals by carbonic acid-promoted dissolution. We predict that elevated CO2 levels will select for microbial communities enriched in organisms that can recapture CO2 into biomass, decreasing negative side effects of CO2 leakage from geological repositories.;derived from metagenome",,96.5,95,91.8,3,,"Good","2016-11-19T12:03:00.589Z","2016-11-19T12:03:00.589Z"

This study showed that the succession of the microbial community coincide with the genomes’ use of hydrocarbon substrates. In general, n-alkane users will rise first, succeeded by mono-ring aromotics, then by multi-ring aromatics. The succession pattern was probably controlled by nutrient availability and the metabolic rates that the group of substrates can sustain.

Initially detected in an aphid-associated V. faba seedling growth cabinet, it induced typical soft rot in all aphid-harboring plants. The causal agent was identified as Chryseobacterium sp., close to C. indologenes by 16S amplicon sequencing, but not identical to any characterized species. This prompted us to characterize this F3_Prior strain and determine its genome sequence. The genome consists of a circular chromosome of 5,277 Kb without plasmid. The main phenotypic traits of strain F3_Prior are heavy enzyme secretion, among which pectinases and proteases, no direct transmission by aphids at notable frequency but showing increased symptoms on aphid-infected plants, and potential migration through xylem pathway from crown to apex during in planta artificial infection. Very recently, this strain was shown to belong to the same species as strain JV274.1, a PGPR strain on maize, which was characterized by colleagues (Vacheron et al. 2017), and published as a novel species in a companion paper (Muller et al. in prep).","collected_by:Yvan Rahb�",96.8,95.4,,,,"Good","2020-07-29T19:31:30.509Z","2020-07-29T19:31:30.509Z"

In parallel, we are using cultivation-independent methods, including DNA-stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP), using labelled isoprene, to retrieve sequence data of active organisms that may be resistant to laboratory cultivation. Labelled DNA from DNA-SIP experiments is used for amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA and metabolically functional genes, which provides phylogenetic information on active isoprene degraders.

'Candidatus (Ca.) Methanoperedens spp.' archaea are cytochrome-containing versatile members of the ANME-2d group, performing nitrate-dependent methane conversion. There is increasing evidence that 'Ca. Methanoperedens spp.' are able to perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), such as during methane-dependent reduction of Fe3+ and Mn4+. In this study, a culture highly enriched in 'Ca. Methanoperedens' was used to investigate its ability to perform EET. The enrichment culture oxidized 13CH4 with concomitant reduction of graphene oxide, supporting the metabolic possibility of EET by 'Ca. Methanoperedens'. Furthermore, a two-chamber electrochemical system with an applied potential of 400 mV vs standard hydrogen electrode was used to invoke current production. A biofilm developed on the working electrode and low-density electrical current was produced. The presence of redox centers at -140 to -160 mV and at -230 mV in the biofilm was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry scans. Metagenomic analysis and Fluorescence in situ hybridization of the biofilm showed that 'Ca. Methanoperedens sp.' was a significant member of the biofilm community. Other members of the community included Zoogloea sp. (Betaproteobacteria), Dechloromonas sp. (Betaproteobacteria), two members of the Bacteroidetes, and the Spirochete Leptonema illini. Current generation appeared to depend more on acetate than on methane. Genes encoding proteins potentially involved in EET were identified in Zoogloea sp., Dechloromonas sp. and one member of the Bacteroidetes. We therefore hypothesize that 'Ca. Methanoperedens sp.' produces acetate that is subsequently used as substrate for EET. Whether 'Ca. Methanoperedens spp.' can directly perform EET remains to be elucidated.","sample_type:metagenomic assembly",89.7,89.4,,,,"Good","2019-10-27T22:27:28.721Z","2019-10-27T22:27:28.721Z"

The metabolic processes that sustain them, however, are poorly understood. In this study, we used metagenomic and biogeochemical approaches to study the microbial communities in 16 physicochemically diverse mountainous and glacial soils from remote sites in South Victoria Land, north of the Mackay Glacier. We assembled 451 metagenome-assembled genomes from 18 bacterial and archaeal phyla, constituting the largest resource of Antarctic soil microbial genomes to date. The most abundant and prevalent microorganisms are metabolically versatile aerobes that use atmospheric hydrogen and carbon monoxide to meet energy, carbon, and, through metabolic water production, hydration needs. Phylogenetic analysis and structural modelling infer that bacteria from nine phyla can scavenge atmospheric hydrogen using a previously unreported enzyme family, the group 1l [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Consistently, gas chromatography measurements confirmed most soils rapidly consume atmospheric hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and provide the first experimental evidence of methane oxidation in non-maritime Antarctica. We also recovered genomes of microorganisms capable of oxidizing other inorganic compounds, including nitrogen, sulfur, and iron compounds, as well as harvesting solar energy via photosystems and novel microbial rhodopsins. Bacterial lineages defined by symbiotic lifestyles, including Patescibacteria, Chlamydiae, and predatory Bdellovibrionota, were also surprisingly abundant. We conclude that the dominant microorganisms in Antarctic soils adopt mixotrophic strategies for energy and sometimes carbon acquisition, though they co-exist with diverse bacteria and archaea that adopt more specialist lifestyles. These unprecedented insights and associated genome compendium will inform efforts to protect biodiversity in this continent.","sample_type:metagenomic assembly",91.6,88.5,,,"Low contig N50","Poor","2020-08-31T01:01:41.624Z","2020-08-31T01:01:41.624Z"

For most lakes and ponds, the data includes a vertical sample set spanning the oxic surface waters to anoxic bottom layers.

These uncultured genomes substantially expand the known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota, with a 281% increase in phylogenetic diversity. Although the newly identified species are less prevalent in well-studied populations compared to reference isolate genomes, they improve classification of understudied African and South American samples by more than 200%. These candidate species encode hundreds of newly identified biosynthetic gene clusters and possess a distinctive functional capacity that might explain their elusive nature.

Here we identify 1,952 uncultured candidate bacterial species by reconstructing 92,143 metagenome-assembled genomes from 11,850 human gut microbiomes. These uncultured genomes substantially expand the known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota, with a 281% increase in phylogenetic diversity. Although the newly identified species are less prevalent in well-studied populations compared to reference isolate genomes, they improve classification of understudied African and South American samples by more than 200%. These candidate species encode hundreds of newly identified biosynthetic gene clusters and possess a distinctive functional capacity that might explain their elusive nature. Our work expands the known diversity of uncultured gut bacteria, which provides unprecedented resolution for taxonomic and functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota.;This sample represents a MAG from the metagenomic run ERR1018268",,,,,,,"Good","2019-07-18T02:52:21.011Z","2019-07-18T02:52:21.011Z"

In this work, we used a novel approach that mimics the natural environment by using a Miniaturized Culture Chip (MCC) allowing the isolation of several bacterial strains from Antarctic shallow water sediments under near natural conditions. One of the strains, a Gram- negative Antarctic bacterium belonging to the genus Aequorivita was subjected to further analyses. The genome of the Aequorivita sp. was sequenced and a bioinformatics approach was applied to identify putative biosynthetic gene clusters. The organic extract of the Aequorivita sp. showed antimicrobial activity towards a panel of Multidrug Resistant (MDR) bacteria and antihelminthic activity against the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.

Our study endeavors to define the relative abundance of many species comprising the dental plaque microbiome in twin pairs discordant for dental caries in association and longitudinal studies. The study power afforded by the use of discordant twin pairs for dental caries is substantially greater than similar studies using unrelated individuals. Next, we will compare the caries-free and caries-active microbiomes by deep metagenomic sequencing to identify differentially abundant genes and metabolic pathways. Lastly, we will determine the functional relevance of differentially abundant species, strains and genes by conducting targeted meta-transcriptomic studies. The statistical significance of all of the datasets will be determined which will allow for the widespread identification of species, strains, genes and transcripts associated with dental caries and dental health.

The main constituents of ulvan are 3-sulfated rhamnose (Rha3S), D-glucuronic acid (GlcA), L-iduronic acid (IdoA), and D-xylose (Xyl). The repetition moieties are disaccharides composed of Rha3S linked with GlcA or IdoA, termed ulvanobiuronic acid A or B, respectively, or xylose in lower amounts. Conversion from polymers into fermentable oligomers requires chemical or biological break down. However, the process of chemical conversion could be very expensive and not be worthwhile to use for an economical large-scale production. The enzymatic hydrolysis has been suggested as a more environmentally and economically treatment due to the low energy requirement, less byproduct production. Thus, discovery of new enzymes for ulvan degradation becomes a key step for better managing and utilizing this resource.",,94.5,69.8,,,,"Good","2020-02-07T13:50:54.571Z","2020-02-07T13:50:54.571Z"

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","collected_by:Children's National Hospital",96.9,95.7,,,,"Good","2020-04-26T14:24:57.126Z","2020-04-26T14:24:57.126Z"

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally: •Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. •Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and Pac Biosequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences disclaimer icon at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). •Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases. The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","collected_by:Children's National Hospital",97.7,96.7,100,,,"Good","2017-07-23T01:52:47.371Z","2017-07-23T01:52:47.371Z"

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","collected_by:BEI Resources/American Type and Culture Collection (ATCC)",98.1,97.8,,,,"Good","2019-12-31T17:24:04.609Z","2019-12-31T17:24:04.609Z"

Here, metagenomics and network inference of the endophytic root microbiome of plants grown in soil suppressive to the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani, revealed high abundance of Chitinophagaceae and Flavobacteriaceae and a rich metabolic diversity of 730 biosynthetic gene clusters with only 12 known. Chitinase and NRPS genes were expressed in these endophytic bacterial families primarily upon pathogen challenge of the roots. Following de novo genome assembly, a consortium of endophytic Chitinophaga and Flavobacterium was reconstructed that suppressed root disease more consistently than individual members. CRISPR-Cas-based mutagenesis further revealed that a novel NRPS-PKS hybrid gene cluster from Flavobacterium was key to the disease-suppressive activity of the endophytic consortium. Our results highlight that endophytic root microbiomes harbor a wealth of yet unknown functional traits that, in concert, can protect the plant inside out.",,97.8,95.6,,,,"Good","2019-10-03T08:49:59.844Z","2019-10-03T08:49:59.844Z"

But, cross-reactions between 2 or more serotypes such as A, E and I are common and some strains are not typeable with available antisera. MALDI-TOF MS characterisation of 59O. rhinotracheale strains reviled that serotypes F (LMG 18856), serotypes K (LMG 18861) and serotypes M (LMG 19032) could be different species. To gain better knowledge of these strains NGS data was obtained.","sample_type:bacterial cell culture",99.9,99.6,,,,"Good","2019-11-25T20:30:51.886Z","2019-11-25T20:30:51.886Z"

Second, using an already-in-place innovative crowdsourcing approach, we will engage hundreds of undergraduate microbiology students to phenotypically screen the isolates for antimicrobial activity. Third, we will put in place a high quality analysis pipeline to validate and characterize the most promising leads at the genomic, phenotypic, and chemical level. The anticipated outputs of the program include new knowledge of extremophile biology, discovery of leads of high value to industrial partners, and the training of highly qualified personnel with transdisciplinary expertise.","sample_type:Bacterial culture;biomaterial_provider:Dr. Lyle Whyte;collected_by:Ianina Altshuler",99.4,98.1,,,,"Good","2019-09-30T08:55:45.792Z","2019-09-30T08:55:45.792Z"

In general, n-alkane users will rise first, succeeded by mono-ring aromotics, then by multi-ring aromatics. The succession pattern was probably controlled by nutrient availability and the metabolic rates that the group of substrates can sustain.

Dental caries has a well-established link to discrete, but only partially characterized changes in the dental plaque microbiome. Our study endeavors to define the relative abundance of many species comprising the dental plaque microbiome in twin pairs discordant for dental caries in association and longitudinal studies. The study power afforded by the use of discordant twin pairs for dental caries is substantially greater than similar studies using unrelated individuals. Next, we will compare the caries-free and caries-active microbiomes by deep metagenomic sequencing to identify differentially abundant genes and metabolic pathways. Lastly, we will determine the functional relevance of differentially abundant species, strains and genes by conducting targeted meta-transcriptomic studies. The statistical significance of all of the datasets will be determined which will allow for the widespread identification of species, strains, genes and transcripts associated with dental caries and dental health. These approaches are likely to enhance our understanding of dental caries onset and development and may enable in the future the development of novel treatment strategies.;derived from metagenome","sample_type:metagenomic assembly",98,70.7,,,"Too many contigs;Low Fine consistency score","Poor","2018-11-28T23:29:44.289Z","2018-11-28T23:29:44.289Z"

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","collected_by:Children's National Hospital",97.9,96.1,,,,"Good","2018-11-30T03:13:42.854Z","2018-11-30T03:13:42.854Z"
